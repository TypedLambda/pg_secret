* Cleanup code (make api functions only deal with Secret type)
* Package as an extension
* Make out function encode data as B64
* Store (or workout how to retrieve) the original data value (maybe a simple AES block encrypt)
* Determine how to avoid accidentally logging the key in psql sessions or elsewhere
* Decode keys from base64 or binary (_in vs _recv)
* Can the prf_key be safely derived from the prp_key or vice-versa?
